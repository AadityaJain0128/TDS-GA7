                    Let's begin with the top-line numbers.
                    (Click 1) We saw robust revenue growth of 15%, driven by new product adoption.
                    (Click 2) This translated into a strong 20% increase in net income.
                    (Click 3) And an 18% increase in EPS, delivering significant value to our shareholders.
                    (Click 4) Importantly, our operating margin expanded by 200 basis points, showing improved efficiency across the board. This is a key highlight for this quarter.

                    ## Deep Dive: Key Performance Metrics

                    Our growth is underpinned by strong user engagement and efficient marketing.

                    | Metric | Q3 2024 | Q3 2025 | Change |
                    |---|---|---|---|
                    | Monthly Active Users (MAU) | 4.2 M | 5.1 M | +21% |
                    | Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | $55 | $52 | -5.5% |
                    | Lifetime Value (LTV) | $180 | $210 | +16.7% |

                    The LTV/CAC ratio has improved to **4.04**, a very healthy indicator of sustainable growth.
                </script>
                <aside class="notes">
                    Now let's go beyond the financial statements.
                    Our user base continues to expand rapidly, with Monthly Active Users up 21%.
                    At the same time, our marketing has become more efficient, as shown by the decrease in Customer Acquisition Cost.
                    Most importantly, the Lifetime Value of our customers is increasing. This combination leads to an excellent LTV to CAC ratio of over 4, a core driver of our long-term profitability.

                <h2>Technological Advancements</h2>
                <p>We've deployed a new Python-based risk model for portfolio analysis.</p>
                <pre><code class="python" data-line-numbers="3-5|8-10">
import numpy as np

def calculate_portfolio_volatility(weights, returns_df):
    # Calculate daily returns covariance matrix
    cov_matrix = returns_df.cov() * 252 # Annualize
    
    # Calculate portfolio variance
    port_variance = np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights))
    
    # Calculate portfolio volatility (standard deviation)
    port_volatility = np.sqrt(port_variance)
    return port_volatility

# Example: 40% stock A, 60% stock B
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.6])
# returns_df would be a pandas DataFrame of asset returns
                </code></pre>
                <aside class="notes">
                    On the technology front, our innovation continues to provide a competitive edge. This quarter, we rolled out a new risk model. Here's a simplified code snippet.
                    (Click 1) The core logic calculates the annualized covariance of asset returns.
                    (Click 2) It then applies the portfolio weights to determine overall portfolio variance and finally volatility.
                    This new model is 30% faster and allows for more complex scenario analysis, directly improving our risk management capabilities.

                <h2>Financial Modeling & Projections</h2>
                <p>Our project valuation models are based on standard financial principles.</p>
                
                <h4>Net Present Value (NPV)</h4>
                <p>We use NPV to evaluate the profitability of new ventures:</p>
                $$ NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} - C_0 $$
                
                <div class="fragment" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    <h4>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</h4>
                    <p>To measure long-term performance:</p>
                    $$ CAGR = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 $$
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    Looking forward, our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and data-driven. Our primary tool for evaluating new projects is the Net Present Value formula, which allows us to discount future cash flows back to today's value.
                    (Click 1) We also use CAGR extensively to smooth out volatility and understand the true annual growth rate of our key metrics over time. These tools ensure we invest in projects that create real, quantifiable value.
