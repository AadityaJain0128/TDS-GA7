## **Core Features**

- **Scalable Architecture:** Built to handle enterprise-level loads.
- **Real-time Analytics:** Instant insights from your data streams.
- **Secure API:** End-to-end encryption with OAuth 2.0.

## **Performance Analysis**

Our core search algorithm is highly optimized for performance and efficiency.

- **Average Case Complexity:** The average time complexity is $O(n \log n)$, which is excellent for large datasets.
- **Master Theorem:** The performance can be described by the following recurrence relation:

$$
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(n)
$$

This demonstrates a balanced partitioning strategy that ensures fast processing.

## **API Example: Fetching User Data**

Here is a quick example of how to fetch user data using our Python client.

```python
import phoenix_client

# Initialize the client with your API key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
client = phoenix_client.Client(api_key)

try:
    # Fetch user data by user ID
    user_id = "usr_12345"
    user_data = client.get_user(user_id)
    print(f"Successfully retrieved data for: {user_data['name']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
